Nowcast Beach Status

Nowcast Beach Status predicts water quality conditions at select beach swimming areas. Nowcast estimates conditions similar to a weather forecast, by merging environment and climate data with variables measured at a beach by 8 AM each morning and entering them into a computer program. The program provides a probability from 1 to 100 as to whether or not the beach has exceeded the bathing-water standard of 235 colony forming units of E. coli.
