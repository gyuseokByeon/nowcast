            <h4>Welcome to the NowCast -- <i>A daily nowcast of recreational water quality conditions</i></h4>

            <p>
                <b>Is it safe to swim in the lake or canoe in the river?</b> To find out, local agencies monitor
                the water daily to determine concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), such as
                <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i>, found in sewage and other animal wastes. But because results
                of FIB levels take 18-24 hours by conventional methods, we are using other quickly-obtained
                measurements to estimate when FIB levels will be high. This is called a “nowcast.”
            </p>

            <h4>Why do we need the NowCast?</h4>

            <p>States use standards for FIB (fecal indicator bacteria) to assess whether the water quality is acceptable for swimming or other recreational
                activities. FIB, such as E. coli, are not usually disease causing but are found in the gastrointestinal tract
                of healthy warm-blooded animals, including humans, and their feces. The presence of FIB is an indicator that
                disease-causing organisms are also likely to be present.</p>

            <p>For Great Lakes swimming areas, if the level of <i>E. coli</i> goes over the recreational water quality standard, the
                manager at the swimming area will take action based on the State regulations. <i>E. coli</i> concentrations are
                measured in most probable number per 100 mL (MPN/100mL) or colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (CFU/100mL),
                depending on the analytical method used. A milliliter is a unit of volume in the metric system; 100 milliliters
                is equivalent to just under ½ cup. The table below summarizes the recreational water quality standards (as
                used for the NowCast) for states with participating NowCast beaches.</p>

            <table class="table table-bordered center-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            <p>What is commonly done to monitor recreational water quality is to collect a water sample from the swimming area
                or stream, transport the sample to a laboratory, and determine numbers of FIB in the sample. The problem
                is that it takes at least 18 hours to grow FIB in the laboratory. Unfortunately, by the time FIB results are
                compiled, water-quality conditions may have already changed. By contrast, it takes less than an hour to estimate
                recreational water quality using the predictive model and transmit results through the NowCast.</p>

            <h4>How does the NowCast work? </h4>

            <p>A nowcast estimates current conditions similar to how a weather “forecast” looks to the future.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>The NowCast is a mathematical system that uses easily measured environmental and water-quality “variables,”
                    such as turbidity and rainfall, to estimate levels of FIB (fecal indicator bacteria). Mathematical models are developed from several
                    years of measurements taken at a particular site, and all models used in the NowCast are swimming area
                    or site specific.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>The NowCast for swimming areas provides the probability (in percent) that the established state recreational
                water quality standard will be exceeded. So on any given morning, there could be from a 1- to 100- percent
                probability that the standard would be exceeded. How does one know when the probability presents too great
                a risk to go swimming? Would you go swimming if there was an 80-percent probability that the standard would
                be exceeded? What about a 25 percent chance? To help out, managers at swimming areas establish a site-specific
                threshold probability based on historical data.</p>

            <p>The NowCast for the Cuyahoga River at Jaite provides a predicted <i>E. coli</i> concentration. Daily information on
                whether the predicted concentration exceeds or does not exceed 235 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 mL will be posted
                online. For the Cuyahoga River, the daily predicted <i>E. coli</i> concentration will be for information only. The
                park managers will not issue advisories based on these estimates.</p>

            <p>
                NowCast variables are measured each morning and then entered into a computer program. The program provides the
                probability of exceeding the bathing-water standard (used for bathing beaches) and the estimated <i>E. coli</i>
                concentration (used for the Cuyahoga River). Because the NowCast assessments of recreational water quality
                are ready within an hour, they are better than the old methods that take 18 hours to complete. The NowCast
                results are also used to report swimming area monitoring sample results through the 
                <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/beachguardpublic/" target="_blank">Ohio Department of Health’s
                    beach monitoring program</a>, <a href="https://www.eriecountypa.gov/county-services/health-department/environmental-services/beaches/beach-monitoring-and-lab-analyses.aspx" target="_blank">
                Pennsylvania’s Erie County Department of Health beach monitoring program</a>, and New York
                State Department of Health, Bureau of Community Environmental Health and Food Protection.
            </p>

            <p>The NowCasts for swimming area advisories or closures, presented on this website, are estimates of the probability
                of FIB concentrations exceeding safe levels in the waters at the swimming areas right now. Similarly, the
                NowCast for the Cuyahoga River is an estimate of the current <i>E. coli</i> concentration. Obviously, there is some
                uncertainty with a nowcast, just as there is uncertainty with a weather forecast; but past tests have shown
                that nowcasting does fairly well in determining whether the swimming area is safe for swimming.</p>

            <h4>Do predictions or advisories indicate if a swimming area is open or closed to the public?</h4>

            <p>Advisories are not an indication of whether a swimming area is open or closed to the public. That decision may
                or may not be related to water quality, often because factors beyond water quality — such as wave conditions,
                rip currents, debris, or other issues — also affect the actual status of a swimming area.</p>

            <p>For the latest status at Cleveland, Ohio area beaches―Edgewater Beach, Villa Angela Beach, or Huntington Reservation―please

                <a href="https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/swimming" target="_blank">swimming website</a>.</p>

            <h4>How did the NowCast perform in past years?</h4>

            <p>
                <strong>NowCasts were provided to the public at 22 recreational areas (21 beaches and 1 recreational river) during the recreational season of 2017. Performance of the nowcast model was compared to using the persistence method (using the previous samples’s E. coli to predict the current day’s E. coli concentration) at those swimming areas.</strong>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>At 12/22 recreational areas, the nowcast model performed better than the persistence method in terms of overall percent correct.</li>
                <li>At 5/22 recreational areas, the nowcast model performed better than the persistence method in terms of specificity. Specificity is the percentage of non-exceedances of the water quality standard that were correctly predicted.</li>
                <li>At 20/22 recreational areas, the nowcast model performed better than the persistence method in terms of sensitivity. Sensitivity is the percentage of E. coli exceedances of the bathing-water standard that were correctly predicted.</li>
                <li>The model performed especially well at Lake Erie Beach, NY. The model for this site was able to identify all days where the water quality standard was exceeded.</li>
                <li>The model performed well at Nickel Plate, OH. The model had an overall accuracy of 87.8 percent.</li>
                <li>The model also performed well at Mill Road Beach, PA. The model had an overall accuracy of 89.3 percent and was able to identify 71 percent of the days where the water quality standard was exceeded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>At Huntington, we have been providing nowcasts to the public the longest - 1,081 days during the recreational seasons of 2006-17.</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The nowcast model provided a correct response 84.2 percent of the time.</li>
                <li>The sensitivity of the nowcast model was 61.5 percent. That means that the nowcast model correctly predicted that the standard
                was exceeded on 120 out of 195 days that the standard was actually exceeded.</li>
                <li>The specificity of the nowcast model was 89.2 percent. That means that the nowcast model correctly predicted that the standard was
                NOT exceeded on 790 out of 886 days that the standard was actually NOT exceeded.</li>
                <p><b>The Huntington nowcast continues to provide more accurate information and better estimates of public health risk than the use of the previous day’s <i>E. coli</i> (the current method used by most managers at swimming areas),
                    especially in regard to sensitivity. In addition, nowcast results have been consistent from year-to-year.</b></p>
            </ul>

            <p>The NowCast is a system that uses near real-time information to "nowcast" water-quality conditions at 21 Great Lake swimming areas, and one recreational river.</p>

            <p> As a part of the Great Lakes Beach Health Initiative, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other federal, state,
                and local agencies and universities have developed and implemented the use of predictive modeling at over
                50 swimming areas across the Great Lakes to provide advisories for water-quality. Water quality (specifically,
                high levels of
                <i>E. coli</i> bacteria typically indicate fecal contamination of water) is an important topic at swimming locations
                along the Great Lakes, coastal regions and inland lakes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office
                of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Laboratory (Athens, GA) provided the Virtual Beach
                software that is used extensively to develop predictive models. The models rely heavily on USGS research
                and national monitoring programs, and are considered essential to any swimming area management program working
                toward a real-time advisory systems. Please visit the publications linked below for more information.</p>

            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Swim advisories are issued by managers at swimming areas on the basis of standards for concentrations of bacterial
                indicators—
                <i>Escherichia coli (E. coli)</i> or enterococci for freshwaters and enterococci for marine waters. The analytical
                methods for these organisms, however, take at least 18–24 hours to complete. Recreational water-quality conditions
                may change during this time, leading to erroneous assessments of public-health risk. As a result, some agencies
                have turned to modeling to obtain near-real-time estimates of recreational water quality.
            </p>
            <h5>Statistical models</h5>
            <p>
                Techniques such as multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to develop multivariable statistical models on the
                basis of relations between fecal-indicator bacteria concentrations and variables known or suspected to affect
                their concentrations in a particular water body. The sources of fecal contamination do not need to be identified
                in order to develop and use statistical models. Multivariable statistical models (hereinafter “predictive
                models”) are being developed and tested in many areas of the USA. They are used for swimming area closure
                or advisory decisions at several areas in the Great Lakes including the NowCast sites.
            </p>
            <h5>Project partners</h5>
            <p>
                The NowCast is the result of multi-year partnerships on several projects between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS),
                and other federal, state, and local agencies and universities. Current and past partners include Chautauqua County
                Department of Health (NY), Cleveland Metroparks (OH), Cuyahoga County Board of Health (OH), Erie County Health Department
                (OH), Erie County Department of Health (NY), Erie County Department of Health (PA), Lake County General Health District
                (OH), Monroe County Health Department (NY), Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District (OH), New York State Department of
                Health, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (OH),
                Ohio Department of Health, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Ohio Lake Erie Office, Ohio Water Development Authority,
                University of Toledo (OH), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. National Park Service.

                In Ohio, the use of predictive models was first explored with one year data at three Lake Erie swimming areas
                (
                <a href="https://oh.water.usgs.gov/reports/Abstracts/wrir.98-4241.html" target="_blank">Francy and Darner, 1998</a>). This effort was expanded to include three additional Lake Erie swimming areas,
                one inland lake, and two seasons of data collection (
                <a href="https://oh.water.usgs.gov/reports/Abstracts/wrir02-4285.html"
                   target="_blank">Francy and others, 2002</a>). Predictive models were subsequently developed for five Ohio Lake Erie swimming
                areas with 2-4 years of data, depending on the swimming area (
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2006/5192/"
                   target="_blank">Francy and others, 2006</a>). The best model for each swimming area was based on a unique combination of
                variables that explained changes in
                <i>E. coli</i> concentrations. The "variables" included turbidity (water clarity), rainfall, wave
                height,water temperature, day of the year, and lake level. The model from Huntington (Bay Village) was validated
                using data collected during a independent year, leading to implementation of the Ohio NowCast for Huntington
                in 2006. At the same time, a rapid analytical method was tested at river sites within the Cuyahoga Valley
                National Park (Brecksville, OH)
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1210/" target="_blank">(Brady, 2007)</a> and later, models with turbidity as an explanatory variable were developed
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1192/"
                   target="_blank">(Brady and Plona 2009, 2015)</a>. Continuing the work in Lake Erie, data were collected during the recreational
                season of 2007 to test and refine predictive models at Huntington, Edgewater (Cleveland), and Villa Angela
                (Cleveland) (
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1427" target="_blank">Francy and Darner, 2007</a>). The Huntington and Edgewater models performed well, and Edgewater was added
                to the Ohio NowCast in 2008. Data were collected during 2008 to operate the NowCast at Huntington and Edgewater
                and monitor the performance of the models
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1066/" target="_blank">(Francy and others, 2009)</a>. In 2011, Maumee Bay State Park was added and in 2012, Villa Angela was added
                to the Ohio NowCast. During 2014, Nickel Plate (Huron, OH), Vermillion Main Street Beach (Vermillion, OH),
                Mentor Headlands State Park (Mentor, OH), Fairport Harbor Lakefront Park Beach (Fairport Harbor, OH) were
                added to the Ohio Nowcast.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Pennsylvania, the use of bacteria predictive models was first explored with two years of data (2004-2005)
                at one Lake Erie swimming area at Presque Isle State Park in Erie (Zimmerman, 2006). This effort was continued
                in 2006 to validate the model using data collected during an independent year (Zimmerman, 2008). The effort was
                expanded in 2010 to include five additional Lake Erie swimming areas at Presque Isle State Park and data collection
                continued 2010-2012 for predictive model development (Francy and others, 2013). The six models continued to be tested
                and refined in subsequent years (2013-2016) and in 2017 the six sites were added to the New York and Ohio Nowcast.
            </p>
            <p>
                In New York, the use of bacteria predictive models was first explored in 2010 at three Lake Erie swimming areas
                at Woodlawn State Park, Evans Town Park and Lake Erie Beach and two Lake Ontario swimming areas at Ontario and Durand.
                Data collection continued 2010-2012 for predictive model development (Francy and others, 2013).  In 2014, two additional
                swimming areas were added to the New York and Ohio Nowcast at Point Gratiot Park and Wright Park.  The seven models have
                continually been refined and are currently in use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The USGS has been working with local agencies to test and develop predictive models at other Great Lakes swimming areas
                and at some inland lake swimming areas. Sites currently with predictive models under development include swimming areas
                in Lorain County (OH) and Macomb County (MI).
            </p>
            <h5>Methods</h5>
            <p>
                The steps to develop statistical models are data collection; exploratory data analysis; model development, selection,
                and diagnosis; determination of model output values; and model validation and refinement. These steps are
                described in detail with examples in
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/tm6b5" target="_blank">Francy and Darner (2006)</a>. Predictive modeling is a dynamic process; that is, models should be continuously
                validated and refined to improve predictions and better protect public health.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tools to compile data and develop predictive models are available on-line through a
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/"
                   target="_blank">USGS report</a>. These tools include software for creating predictive models (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/ceam/virtual-beach-vb">Virtual Beach</a>) developed by
                U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; software to process weather data from the nearest National Weather
                Service airport site (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/">PROCESSNOAA</a>); and a <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/">spreadsheet</a> to process lake-level data from the National Oceanic
                and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Also in the report are results from a study where the USGS worked
                with 23 local and state agencies to improve existing operational NowCast systems at 4 swimming areas and
                expand the use of predictive models in NowCasts at an additional 45 swimming areas throughout the Great Lakes.
                The predictive models were specific to each swimming area, and the best model for each swimming area was
                based on a unique combination of environmental and water-quality variables. During validation of 42 swimming
                areas models in 2012, the models overall performed better than the current method to assess recreational
                water quality (previous day's
                <i>E. coli</i> concentration).

            <h4>What is <i>E. coli</i>?</h4>

            <p>
                <i>Escherichia coli</i> (
                <i>E. coli</i>) is one type of bacteria that is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of humans and other
                warm-blooded animals; it is therefore used as an indicator of fecal contamination of water. Most strains
                of
                <i>E. coli</i> are harmless; however, its presence may indicate that pathogens (disease-causing organisms) also
                are present in the water.</p>

            <h4>What are pathogens, and why is <i>E. coli</i> used to indicate their presence in water?</h4>

            <p>
                <i>E. coli</i> bacterium, which is present in the feces of warm-blooded animals, is commonly associated with
                and is an indicator of several different disease-causing organisms, called pathogens.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Viral pathogens are believed to be the major cause of swimming-associated diseases (Natural Resources Defense Council, 1998).
                    There are more than 100 types of human pathogenic viruses that may be present in fecal-contaminated waters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bacteria are true living cells and are larger than viruses. Waterborne bacterial pathogens in the United States include species
                    in the genera
                    <i>Salmonella</i>,
                    <i>Shigella</i>,
                    <i>Vibrio</i>,
                    <i>Campylobacter</i>, and rare strains of
                    <i>E. coli</i>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Protozoa are one-celled animals. The principal protozoan pathogens that are waterborne are
                    <i>Giardia lamblia</i> and
                    <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Because of its association with pathogens and because it is comparatively easy to grow in the laboratory,
                <i>E. coli</i> is the basis for Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York recreational water-quality standards. There
                are several varieties of pathogenic
                <i>E. coli</i> and hundreds of varieties of harmless
                <i>E. coli</i>. One variety of
                <i>E. coli</i> that is pathogenic has been associated with undercooked ground beef.</p>

            <h4>How are <i>E. coli</i> levels measured?</h4>

            <p>Daily water samples are collected from the swimming area each morning in sterile bottles. The samples are brought
                to the laboratory where they are processed for
                <i>E. coli</i> within 6 hours of collection. The methods used to determine levels of
                <i>E. coli</i> are called membrane filtration and defined substrate technology. During membrane filtration,
                a measured amount of water is poured through a filter to trap bacteria onto the filter. The filter is placed
                on an agar plate and allowed to incubate at a warm temperature overnight. Colonies are counted the next day
                and recorded as colonies per 100 milliliters. A milliliter is a very small quantity of water—about 0.03 fluid
                ounces or one-fifth of a teaspoon. During defined substrate technology, growth medium with an indicator substance
                is added to 100 milliliters of lake water and incubated for 18-24 hours. The presence of
                <i>E. coli</i> is indicated by fluorescence..</p>

            <h4>What is a water quality advisory?</h4>

            <p>A Water Quality Advisory is a public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted at the swimming area,
                to advise the public that current water quality standards are not acceptable for swimming due to elevated
                bacteria levels. A Water Quality Advisory remains in effect until another measurement is made that shows
                that
                <i>E. coli</i> levels are within acceptable limits.</p>

            <h4>How do managers at swimming areas determine when to issue a water quality advisory?</h4>

            <p>There are state standards for
                <i>E. coli</i> in recreational waters. The state standards are based on those recommended by USEPA and determined
                by earlier USEPA studies. In USEPA studies, investigators determined that when
                <i>E. coli</i> levels went up, the number of swimming-associated gastrointestinal illnesses also increased.
                The Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York bathing-water standard for E. coli is a single-sample value of 235 colonies
                per 100 milliliters. If the count for
                <i>E. coli</i> is equal to or above 235, the manager will issue a water-quality advisory or closure (New York only).</p>

            <h4>What are the problems with the current method used for issuing advisories (based on the previous day's <i>E. coli</i> level)?</h4>

            <p>Current methods to assess concentrations of
                <i>E. coli</i> using membrane filtration or other cultural methods take at least 18 hours to complete. During
                this period,
                <i>E. coli</i> levels may increase or decrease substantially. A heavy rainfall may cause an increase in
                <i>E. coli</i> levels overnight. Alternatively, a bright sunny day may cause
                <i>E. coli</i> levels to fall. So, the swimming area may be erroneously posted based on measured
                <i>E. coli</i> levels from the previous day.</p>

            <h4>Why is a site closed?</h4>

            <p>A site may be closed for a number of reasons, such as when the site manager deems the site unsafe for recreation due to elevated bacteria levels,
            lack of lifeguards on duty, or high waves. Currently, only New York allows for closures of recreational sites.</p>

            <h4>What is being done to improve the accuracy of the advisory system?</h4>

            <p>Scientists are developing and testing tools that can provide managers at swimming areas with quick, reliable
                indicators of recreational water-quality conditions. Predictive models are one means to provide these rapid
                assessments. Predictive models use easily and quickly measured water-quality surrogates, such as rainfall
                and wave height, to estimate levels of
                <i>E. coli</i> or the probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded.</p>


            <h4>Is the water safe for swimming?</h4>

            <p>The water at a swimming area may appear to be clear and clean, but it doesn't mean it is safe for swimming. Bacteria
                cannot be seen in the water; it is therefore important to remember the following guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels are typically elevated for 24 to 48 hours after heavy rains as the result of surface
                    runoff.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels may also be elevated when wind velocities and waves are high. These conditions can stir
                    up the bottom sediment in the lake and cause the water to appear turbid, or dirty.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Water-quality signs are posted at the swimming areas. Look for the signs and read the signs to determine
                    whether or not the water is safe. Water quality advisories are issued when water-quality standards are
                    not within safe limits. Swimming in the water under these conditions may result in illness.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>What illnesses may result from swimming in the water?</h4>

            <p>There is a potential for illness to occur when bacteria levels are unsafe. Gastrointestinal upset, including
                nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea may occur as a result of swallowing contaminated water.
                Thereis also a potential for developing upper respiratory infections, in addition to ear and eye infections.
                Skin infections may also occur if an exposed wound is in contact with contaminated water.</p>

            <h4>Who is most at risk for becoming ill?</h4>

            <p>Children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems are most at risk for developing illnesses
                from swimming when bacteria levels are unsafe.</p>

            <h4>What should I do if I became ill after swimming at a swimming area?</h4>

            <p>If you should become ill, or suspect you became ill, after swimming at a swimming area, you should notify your
                doctor and your local health department. Your local health department is interested in tracking illnesses
                that may have resulted from water-contact activities and will conduct follow-up investigations where necessary.</p>

            <h4>Where does pollution at swimming areas come from?</h4>

            <p>Pollution in water at swimming areas can be attributed to several factors, the most common of which are sanitary
                and storm-sewer overflows. In older, urban areas, sanitary and storm-sewer systems were often combined and
                designed to overflow during heavy rains to prevent basement flooding. It is therefore important not to swim
                near storm drains or other discharge pipes.</p>

            <p>Other sources of pollution include sewage-treatment-plant overflows, runoff from lawns and streets, animal wastes
                (especially waterfowl wastes), malfunctioning home and commercial sewage systems, and boating wastes.</p>

            <h4>How can I help keep the swimming area clean?</h4>

            <p>Everyone has a role in keeping the swimming areas clean, safe, and enjoyable places to visit. The following practices
                will help to maintain one of our greatest natural resources--fresh water lakes.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Follow good personal hygiene practices, such as using public restrooms and properly disposing of diapers.
                    Also, don't swim if you have diarrhea.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Properly dispose of pet wastes and garbage.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Don't feed the birds on the beach.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->If you are a boater, comply with rules pertaining to the proper pumping of sewage holding tanks.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Maintain home sewage systems in good working order to prevent the discharge of improperly treated sewage.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Minimize the use of lawn chemicals, pesticides, and other toxic household products.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Conserve water.
                    <br> &nbsp;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <!--&#8226;-->Report any evidence of swimming area pollution to your local health department.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Is there a "pathogen problem" at swimming areas? Are people getting sick?</h4>

            <p>There is no true measure of the magnitude of disease associated with recreational water exposures (USEPA, 1999),
                in Great Lakes or elsewhere. That is because when people get sick after a weekend at the
                swimming area, the cause of illness is unknown. In addition, the illness is not reported unless there was
                an outbreak among a specific population, like a group of athletes participating in a triathlon.</p>

            <p>Swimming in polluted water can make you sick (Natural Resources Defense Council, 1998). Epidemiological studies
                in the United States have consistently found an association between gastrointestinal illness and exposure
                to contaminated recreational waters; the potential for other types of infections is not completely understood
                (USEPA, 1999).</p>

            <h4>How would use of the NowCast and predictive models differ from the current way of assessing swimming safety?</h4>

            <p>Current methods to assess recreational water quality rely on collecting a sample of water from the swimming area,
                transporting it to a laboratory, and determining numbers of indicator organisms, such as
                <i>E. coli</i>. It takes as least 18 hours to grow
                <i>E. coli</i> in the laboratory. Therefore, by the time
                <i>E. coli</i> results are compiled, swimming area water-quality conditions may have already changed. By contrast,
                it takes less than an hour to estimate recreational water quality using the predictive model and transmit
                results through the NowCast.</p>

            <h4>How well do the predictive models work?</h4>

            <p>The NowCast has been operating in Ohio at Huntington since 2006, at Edgewater since 2008, at Maumee Bay State
                Park since 2011, and at Villa Angela since 2012. Performances of the models in the NowCast were monitored
                for those years. If one were to examine the data in hindsight and assume the culture results for
                <i>E. coli</i> were the correct results, we can compare the performance of predictive models to that of using
                the previous day's
                <i>E. coli</i> concentration to predict the current day's
                <i>E. coli</i> concentration, the later being the old method used by many managers at swimming areas. Overall,
                the NowCast provided more correct responses than the previous day's
                <i>E. coli</i> concentration at the four Ohio NowCast swimming areas.</p>

            <h4>Why was the USGS involved in this research?</h4>

            <p>Water quality and quantity are critical topics in which the USGS has developed expertise over many years. The
                relatively recent addition of biological science to the agency's core program creates opportunities to apply
                science in a variety of new ways.</p>

            <p>The USGS did not do this research alone. Agencies that cooperated with us on data collection and model development 
            or provided funding were Chautauqua County Department of Health (NY), Cleveland Metroparks (OH), Cuyahoga County Board 
            of Health (OH), Erie County Health Department (OH), Erie County Department of Health (NY), Erie County Department of Health
            (PA), Lake County General Health District (OH), Monroe County Health Department (NY), Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District
            (OH), New York State Department of Health, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, Northeast Ohio
            Regional Sewer District (OH), Ohio Department of Health, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Ohio Lake Erie Office, Ohio Water
            Development Authority, University of Toledo (OH), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. National Park Service.</p>

            <h4>Are models being developed for other swimming areas?</h4>

            <p>Yes, models are being developed by research institutions and public agencies for other coastal and inland swimming
                areas in the United States and around the world.</p>

            <p>As part of a Great Lakes Beach Health initiative, a USGS Midwest area team worked with local agencies to develop
                and implement the use of predictive models at
                <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/" target="_blank">49 swimming areas across the Great Lakes</a>
            </p>

            <p>USGS offices in Michigan, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania continue to work with agencies to develop and implement
                the use of predictive models along the shores of the Great Lakes and at inland recreation swimming areas.</p>

            <h4>Is anyone else doing the same kind of research? Are other predictive models being used at swimming areas?</h4>

            <p>Yes, the USGS and other researchers are working on developing and testing predictive models at coastal swimming
                areas. Operational models (those used daily to issue swim advisories or closings) that rely on several explanatory
                variables (rainfall, wave height, wind direction, etc.) are being used in other communities in the United
                States, mainly in the Great Lakes. These include swimming areas in
                <a href="https://www.wibeaches.us/apex/f?p=BEACH:HOME:2771212174982467"
                    target="_blank">Wisconsin</a> and in
                <a href="https://www.cpdbeaches.com/pages/home-map/" target="_blank">Chicago, Illinois</a>. Outside of the Great Lakes, operational models are used at beaches in California,
                Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. The USGS Georgia Water Science Center has initiated a bacteria alert program
                for a recreational river that provides the same type of output as the Lake Erie models—the probability that
                the standard will be exceeded (Lawrence, 2005).</p>

            <h4>Is it acceptable to use a model to assess recreational water quality?</h4>

            <p>
                USEPA states that a monitoring program is essential to any swimming area management program and recommends that
                the current
                <i>E. coli</i> laboratory method be used for assessing ambient waters and for making decisions concerning 
                the protection of human health (USEPA 2014). However, USEPA also states that modeling tools may be used
                to supplement, not replace, monitoring. Modeling tools can provide conservative estimates when there is
                a lag time between sampling the water quality and obtaining results. If models are properly developed and
                applied, they can be used in making advisory or closing decisions at swimming areas (USEPA 2014).

            <h4>Glossary of Terms</h4>
            <p>These definitions of water-related terms might help you understand our Web site better. They are not universal definitions, so other definitions may be valid. This list was compiled from a number of sources and should not be considered an official Cuyahoga County Board of Health or U.S. Geological Survey glossary.</p>
   
            <p><b>Bacterium (bacteria, plural)</b>. A small one-celled microorganism that can either be free living or parasitic. Some bacteria are disease causing</p>

            <p><b>Bathing waters</b> are suitable for swimming and other full-body contact exposure where a lifeguard is present.
             
            <p><b>Combined sewer</b>. A sewer that carries both sanitary (sewage) and storm water in the same pipe, often in older, urban areas.</p>

            <p><b>Combined sewer overflow (CSO)</b>. An event that takes place, often with the aid of a control device, that allows for a combined sewer to overflow into area waterways in order to prevent flooding. A CSO event is most likely to occur during a heavy rain event.</p>

            <p><b></a><i id="ecoli">Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>)</b>. A rod shaped, gram-negative bacterium, commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and feces of warm-blooded animals. It is one species within
                the fecal-coliform group of bacteria and is distinguished from other fecal coliforms by biochemical tests. Although most strains of <i>E. coli</i> are harmless, some strains cause illness. <i>E. coli</i> is an "indicator" of fecal contamination and the possible presence of disease-causing organisms. <i>E. coli</i> is the preferred indicator for freshwater recreational waters.</p>
             
            <p><b>Explanatory variable</b>. A quantity of something that varies and can be used to explain increases and decreases in another variable. Explanatory variables for recreational waters include rainfall, wave height, and turbidity, and are used to explain increases and decreases in <i>E. coli</i> concentrations.</p>
             
            <p><b>Fecal coliforms</b>. A group of bacteria that were used in past to establish standards for fecal contamination in recreational waters. Fecal coliforms are still used to establish standards for shellfish-harvesting waters and for some permitting applications. Although they are used to assess fecal contamination of water, some fecal coliforms actually come from nonfecal sources. Fecal coliforms are defined by the methodology used for detection (lactose fermentation at 44.5°C).</p>

            <p><b>Foreshore head</b>. Water level data from a piezometer (shallow ground-water well) installed 20 ft inland from the edge of water. The foreshore head measured in this manner can best be characterized as a combination of the pressure changes due to the local water table, fluctuations in barometric pressure, the water level in the lake, and the pressure variance due to wave action <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1066/" target="_blank">(Francy and others, 2009)</a>.</p>

            <p><b>Indicator bacteria</b>. A type or group of bacteria that indicate the possible presence of disease causing (pathogenic) microorganisms. Indicator bacteria are not usually pathogenic themselves, but they are often associated with pathogens because they are present in large quantities in the feces of warm-blooded animals.</p>

            <p><b>Membrane filtration</b>. A technique used for the detection and enumeration of bacteria from water. This method provides a direct count of bacteria based on the growth of colonies on the surface of a membrane filter through which sample was passed. To assess the sanitary quality of water using bacterial indicators such as <i>E. coli</i>, the number is expressed as colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL).</p>

            <p><b>Milliliter</b>. A milliliter is a metric unit of volume equivalent to one-millionth of a cubic meter. 100 milliliters is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces or slightly less than ½ cup.</p>

            <p><b>Multiple linear regression (MLR)</b>. A standard statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of another variable (response variable). The goal of MLR is to select a group of explanatory variables that explain as much as possible of the variation observed in the response variable, leaving as little variation as possible to unexplained "noise." In the case of predictive models for swimming areas, rainfall and wave height are examples of explanatory variables and <i>E. coli</i> is the response variable.</p>

            <p><b>Nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU)</b>. A unit of measure for the turbidity (cloudiness) of water.</p>

            <p><b>NowCasting</b>. A "NowCast" of recreational water quality is similar to a weather forecast except it provides an estimate of current conditions instead of future conditions. A NowCast gives the probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded and swimming would result in an excessive health risk.</p>

            <p><b>Pathogen</b>. An organism that causes disease.</p>

            <p><b>Photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)</b>. Radiation in the 400-700 nanometer range measured by use of sensor at the swimming area. PAR from the previous day is negatively related to the concentration of <i>E. coli</i> in water at some swimming areas.</p>

            <p><b>Predictive models</b>. Mathematical models that use easily measured environmental and water-quality variables ("explanatory variables"), such as wave height and rainfall, to estimate the <i>E. coli</i> concentration or the probability of exceeding the bathing-water standard of 235 col/100 mL <i>E. coli</i>.</p>

            <p><b>Primary-contact waters</b> are suitable for full-body contact such as swimming, canoeing, and scuba diving.</p>

            <p><b>qPCR</b>. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction. qPCR is a rapid analytical method that can be performed in about 2 hours. It is a molecular method that targets the DNA of a specific organism -- for recreational water-quality, qPCR methods were designed to target genes specific for <i>E. coli</i> or enterococci.</p>
            
            <p><b>Recreational water-quality standards</b>. Standards established by the state and based on recommendations and epidemiological studies from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, they are used to decide when to issue a water-quality advisory. In Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, the single-sample bathing-water standard for <i>E. coli</i> is 235 colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL). In Michigan, the single-sample bathing-water standard for <i>E. coli</i> is 300 colonies per 100 milliliters.This means that when the <i>E. coli</i> concentration is equal to or greater than 235 or 300 col/100 mL, swimming in the water would pose a high risk of illness.</p>
            
            <p><b>Sanitary sewer overflow (SSO)</b>. An event that takes place in which sewage from a sanitary sewer system overflows, or spills, often from a sanitary manhole. A SSO can occur if a blockage is present within a sanitary sewer system and/or there is too much flow.</p>

            <p><b>Threshold probability</b>. To decided whether or not there's too great a risk to go swimming on any particular day, managers at swimming areas establish a site-specific threshold probability based on historical data. Probabilities equal to or above the threshold would indicate to the swimming area manager that <i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely above the standard, and an advisory would be issued.  Probabilities below the threshold indicate that <i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely below the standard.</p>

            <p><b>Turbidity</b>. A quantitative value for the clarity of water sample--the higher the turbidity the more cloudy the water. Turbidity is measured with a turbidimeter, which measures the scattering effect that suspended particles have on light.</p>

            <p><b>Virus</b>. A submicroscopic particle (are too small to be seen by regular light microscopes) that is only able to replicate by taking over the machinery of a living cell. Many viruses cause disease.</p>

            <p><b>Water quality</b>. A term used to describe the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.</p>
            
            <p><b>Water-quality advisory</b>. A public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted at the swimming area and (or) on the Internet, to advise the public that current recreational water-quality standards are not acceptable for swimming because of elevated <i>E. coli</i> levels.</p>
