								weather forecast, by merging environment and climate data with variables measured at a beach by
								8 AM each morning and entering them into a computer program. The program provides a
								probability from 1 to 100 as to whether or not the beach has exceeded the bathing-water
								standard of 235 colony forming units of <i>E. coli</i>.

				As a part of the Great Lakes Beach Health Initiative, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other federal, state, and local
				agencies and universities have developed and implemented the use of predictive modeling at over 50 swimming areas across
				the Great Lakes to provide advisories for water-quality. Water quality (specifically, high levels of
				<i>E. coli</i> bacteria typically indicate fecal contamination of water) is an important topic at swimming locations along
				the Great Lakes, coastal regions and inland lakes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development,
				National Exposure Research Laboratory (Athens, GA) provided the Virtual Beach software that is used extensively to develop
				predictive models. The models rely heavily on USGS research and national monitoring programs, and are considered essential
				to any swimming area management program working toward a real-time advisory system. Please visit the publications linked
				below for more information.

			<h4>FAQ</h4>
			<span style="font-size:139%;">
				<b>What is
					<i>E. coli</i>?</b>
			</span>
			<br>
			<i>Escherichia coli</i> (
			<i>E. coli</i>) is one type of bacteria that is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of humans and other warm-blooded
			animals; it is therefore used as an indicator of fecal contamination of water. Most strains of
			<i>E. coli</i> are harmless; however, its presence may indicate that pathogens (disease-causing organisms) also are present
			in the water.
			<p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-size:139%;">
						<b>What are pathogens, and why is
							<i>E. coli</i> used to indicate their presence in water?</b>
					</span>
					<br> The
					<i>E. coli</i> bacterium, which is present in the feces of warm-blooded animals, is commonly associated with and is an
					indicator of several different disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. &nbsp;
					<ul>
						<li>
							<!--&#8226;-->Viral pathogens are believed to be the major cause of swimming-associated diseases (Natural Resources Defense Council,
							1998). There are more than 100 types of human pathogenic viruses that may be present in fecal-contaminated waters.
							<br> &nbsp;
						</li>
						<li>
							<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria are true living cells and are larger than viruses. Waterborne bacterial pathogens in the United States include
							species in the genera
							<i>Salmonella</i>,
							<i>Shigella</i>,
							<i>Vibrio</i>,
							<i>Campylobacter</i>, and rare strains of
							<i>E. coli</i>.
							<br> &nbsp;
						</li>
						<li>
							<!--&#8226;-->Protozoa are one-celled animals. The principal protozoan pathogens that are waterborne are
							<i>Giardia lamblia</i> and
							<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Because of its association with pathogens and because it is comparatively easy to grow in the laboratory,
						<i>E. coli</i> is the basis for New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio recreational water-quality standards. There are several
						varieties of pathogenic
						<i>E. coli</i> and hundreds of varieties of harmless
						<i>E. coli</i>. One variety of
						<i>E. coli</i> that is pathogenic has been associated with undercooked ground beef.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-size:139%;">
							<b>How are
								<i>E. coli</i> levels measured?</b>
						</span>
						<br> Daily water samples are collected from the swimming area each morning in sterile bottles. The samples are brought
						to the laboratory where they are processed for
						<i>E. coli</i> within 6 hours of collection. The method used to determine levels of
						<i>E. coli</i> is called membrane filtration. During membrane filtration, a measured amount of water is poured through
						a filter to trap bacteria onto the filter. The filter is placed on an agar plate and allowed to incubate at a warm
						temperature overnight. Colonies are counted the next day and recorded as colonies per 100 milliliters. A milliliter
						is a very small quantity of water&#8212;about 0.03 fluid ounces or one-fifth of a teaspoon.
						<p>
							<span style="font-size:139%;">
								<b>What is a water quality advisory?</b>
							</span>
							<br> A Water Quality Advisory is a public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted at the swimming area, to
							advise the public that current water quality standards are not acceptable for swimming due to elevated bacteria levels.
							A Water Quality Advisory remains in effect until another measurement is made that shows that
							<i>E. coli</i> levels are within acceptable limits.
							<p>
								<span style="font-size:139%;">
									<b>How do the managers at the swimming area determine when to issue a water quality advisory?</b>
								</span>
								<br> There are state standards for
								<i>E. coli</i> in recreational waters. The state standards are based on those recommended by USEPA and determined by
								earlier USEPA studies. In USEPA studies, investigators determined that when
								<i>E. coli</i> levels went up, the number of swimming-associated gastrointestinal illnesses also increased. The New
								York, Pennsylvania and Ohio bathing-water standard for E. coli is a single-sample value of 235 colonies per 100 milliliters.
								If the count for
								<i>E. coli</i> is equal to or above 235, the manager will issue a water-quality advisory.
								<p>
									<span style="font-size:139%;">
										<b>What are the problems with the current method used for issuing advisories (based on the previous day&#8217;s
											<i>E. coli</i> level)?</b>
									</span>
									<br> Current methods to assess concentrations of
									<i>E. coli</i> using membrane filtration or other cultural methods take at least 18 hours to complete. During this
									period,
									<i>E. coli</i> levels may increase or decrease substantially. A heavy rainfall may cause an increase in
									<i>E. coli</i> levels overnight. Alternatively, a bright sunny day may cause
									<i>E. coli</i> levels to fall. So, the swimming area may be erroneously posted based on measured
									<i>E. coli</i> levels from the previous day.
									<p>
										<span style="font-size:139%;">
											<b>What is being done to improve the accuracy of the advisory system?</b>
										</span>
										<br> Scientists are developing and testing tools that can provide managers at swimming areas with quick, reliable indicators
										of recreational water-quality conditions. Predictive models are one means to provide these rapid assessments. Predictive
										models use easily and quickly measured water-quality surrogates, such as rainfall and wave height, to estimate
										levels of
										<i>E. coli</i> or the probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded.
										<p>
											<span style="font-size:139%;">
												<b>Is the water safe for swimming?</b>
											</span>
											<br> The water at the swimming area may appear to be clear and clean, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it is safe for swimming.
											Bacteria cannot be seen in the water; it is therefore important to remember the following guidelines: &nbsp;
											<ul>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels are typically elevated for 24 to 48 hours after heavy rains as the result of surface runoff.
													<br> &nbsp;
												</li>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels may also be elevated when wind velocities and waves are high. These conditions can stir up the
													bottom sediment in the lake and cause the water to appear turbid, or dirty.
													<br> &nbsp;
												</li>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Water-quality signs are posted at the swimming areas. Look for the signs and read the signs to determine whether
													or not the water is safe. Water quality advisories are issued when water-quality standards are not within safe
													limits. Swimming in the water under these conditions may result in illness.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												<span style="font-size:139%;">
													<b>What illnesses may result from swimming in the water?</b>
												</span>
												<br> There is a potential for illness to occur when bacteria levels are unsafe. Gastrointestinal upset, including
												nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea may occur as a result of swallowing contaminated water. There
												is also a potential for developing upper respiratory infections, in addition to ear and eye infections. Skin
												infections may also occur if an exposed wound is in contact with contaminated water.
												<p>
													<span style="font-size:139%;">
														<b>Who is most at risk for becoming ill?</b>
													</span>
													<br> Children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems are most at risk for developing illnesses
													from swimming when bacteria levels are unsafe.
													<p>
														<span style="font-size:139%;">
															<b>What should I do if I became ill after swimming at a swimming area?</b>
														</span>
														<br> If you should become ill, or suspect you became ill, after swimming at a swimming area, you should notify
														your doctor and your local health department. Your local health department is interested in tracking illnesses
														that may have resulted from water-contact activities and will conduct follow-up investigations where necessary.
														<p>
															<span style="font-size:139%;">
																<b>Where does pollution at a swimming area come from?</b>
															</span>
															<br> Pollution in the water at a swimming area can be attributed to several factors, the most common of which
															are sanitary and storm-sewer overflows. In older, urban areas, sanitary and storm-sewer systems were often
															combined and designed to overflow during heavy rains to prevent basement flooding. It is therefore important
															not to swim near storm drains or other discharge pipes.
															<p>
																Other sources of pollution include sewage-treatment-plant overflows, runoff from lawns and streets, animal wastes (especially
																waterfowl wastes), malfunctioning home and commercial sewage systems, and boating wastes.
																<p>
																	<p>
																		<span style="font-size:139%;">
																			<b>How can I help keep the swimming area clean?</b>
																		</span>
																		<br> Everyone has a role in keeping the swimming areas clean, safe, and enjoyable places to visit. The following
																		practices will help to maintain one of our greatest natural resources&#8212;fresh water lakes. &nbsp;
																		<ul>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Follow good personal hygiene practices, such as using public restrooms and properly disposing of diapers.
																				Also, don&#8217;t swim if you have diarrhea.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Properly dispose of pet wastes and garbage.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->If you are a boater, comply with rules pertaining to the proper pumping of sewage holding tanks.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Maintain home sewage systems in good working order to prevent the discharge of improperly treated sewage.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Minimize the use of lawn chemicals, pesticides, and other toxic household products.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Conserve water.
																				<br> &nbsp;
																			</li>
																			<li>
																				<!--&#8226;-->Report any evidence of pollution at swimming areas to your local health department.
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																		<p>
																			<span style="font-size:139%;">
																				<b>Is there a &#8220;pathogen problem&#8221; at swimming areas? Are people getting sick?</b>
																			</span>
																			<br> There is no true measure of the magnitude of disease associated with recreational water exposures (USEPA,
																			1999), in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio or elsewhere. That is because when people get sick after a weekend
																			at a swimming area, the cause of illness is unknown. In addition, the illness is not reported unless there
																			was an outbreak among a specific population, like a group of athletes participating in a triathlon.
																			<p>
																				Swimming in polluted water can make you sick (Natural Resources Defense Council, 1998). Epidemiological studies in the United
																				States have consistently found an association between gastrointestinal illness and exposure to contaminated
																				recreational waters; the potential for other types of infections is not completely understood (USEPA,
																				1999).
																				<p>
																					<span style="font-size:139%;">
																						<b>How would use of the nowcasting system and predictive models differ from the current way of assessing
																							swimming safety?</b>
																					</span>
																					<br> Current methods to assess recreational water quality rely on collecting a sample of water from the
																					swimming area, transporting it to a laboratory, and determining numbers of indicator organisms, such
																					as
																					<i>E. coli</i>. It takes as least 18 hours to grow
																					<i>E. coli</i> in the laboratory. Therefore, by the time
																					<i>E. coli</i> results are compiled, water-quality conditions may have already changed. By contrast, it
																					takes less than an hour to estimate recreational water quality using the predictive model and transmit
																					results through the nowcasting system.
																					<p>
																						<span style="font-size:139%;">
																							<b>How well do the predictive models work?</b>
																						</span>
																						<br> The nowcast has been operating in Ohio at Huntington since 2006, at Edgewater since 2008, at Maumee
																						Bay State Park since 2011, and at Villa Angela since 2012. Performances of the models in the nowcast
																						were monitored for those years. If one were to examine the data in hindsight and assume the culture
																						results for
																						<i>E. coli</i> were the correct results, we can compare the performance of predictive models to that of
																						using the previous day&#8217;s
																						<i>E. coli</i> concentration to predict the current day&#8217;s
																						<i>E. coli</i> concentration, the later being the old method used by many managers at swimming areas.
																						Overall, the nowcast provided more correct responses than the previous day&#8217;s
																						<i>E. coli</i> concentration at the four Ohio nowcast swimming areas.
																						<p>
																							<span style="font-size:139%;">
																								<b>Why was the USGS involved in this research?</b>
																							</span>
																							<br> Water quality and quantity are critical topics in which the USGS has developed expertise over many
																							years. The relatively recent addition of biological science to the agency&#8217;s core program creates
																							opportunities to apply science in a variety of new ways.
																							<p>
																								The USGS did not do this research alone. State, county, and local agencies cooperated with USGS on data collection and model
																								development or provided funding.
																								<p>
																									<span style="font-size:139%;">
																										<b>Are models being developed for other swimming areas?</b>
																									</span>
																									<br> Yes, models are being developed by research institutions and public agencies for other coastal
																									and inland swimming areas in the United States.
																									<p>
																										As part of a Great Lakes Beach Health initiative, a USGS Midwest area team worked with local agencies to develop and implement
																										the use of predictive models at
																										<a href="https:/pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/">49 swimming areas across the Great Lakes</a>.
																										<p>
																											New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio continue to work with agencies to develop and implement the use of predictive models along
																											the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario and at inland recreation swimming areas.

																													<b>Is anyone else doing the same kind of research? Are other predictive models being used at swimming
																														areas?</b>
																												</span>
																												<br> Yes, the USGS and other researchers are working on developing and testing predictive models
																												at coastal swimming areas. Operational models (those used daily to issue swim advisories or closings)
																												that rely on several explanatory variables (rainfall, wave height, wind direction, etc.) are
																												being used in other communities in the United States, mainly in the Great Lakes. These include
																												swimming areas in
																												<a href="https://www.wibeaches.us/apex/f?p=BEACH:HOME:2771212174982467">Wisconsin</a> and in
																												<a href="https://www.cpdbeaches.com/pages/home-map/">Chicago, Illinois</a>. The USGS Georgia Water Science Center has initiated a bacteria alert program
																												for a recreational river that provides the same type of output as the Lake Erie models&#8212;the
																												probability that the standard will be exceeded (Lawrence, 2005).
																												<p>
																													<span style="font-size:139%;">
																														<b>Is it acceptable to use a model to assess recreational water quality?</b>
																													</span>
																													<br> USEPA states that a monitoring program is essential to any swimming area management program
																													and recommends that the current
																													<i>E. coli</i> laboratory method be used for assessing ambient waters and for making decisions
																													concerning the protection of human health (USEPA 2002, p. 4-17). However, USEPA also states
																													that modeling tools may be used to supplement, not replace, monitoring. Modeling tools can provide
																													conservative estimates when there is a lag time between sampling the water quality and obtaining
																													results. If models are properly developed and applied, they can be used in making advisory or
																													closing decisions at swimming areas (USEPA 2002, p. 4-22).

			<h4>Glossary of Terms</h4>
			<p>
				These definitions of water-related terms might help you understand our Web site better. They are not universal definitions,
				so other definitions may be valid. This list was compiled from a number of sources and should not be considered an official
				U.S. Geological Survey glossary. &nbsp;
				<p>
					<p>
						<b>Bacterium (bacteria, plural)</b>. A small one-celled microorganism that can either be free living or parasitic. Some
						bacteria are disease causing.
						<p>
							<b>
								<a name="Bathing waters"></a>Bathing waters</b> are suitable for swimming and other full-body contact exposure where a lifeguard is present.
							<p>
								<b>Combined sewer</b>. A sewer that carries both sanitary (sewage) and storm water in the same pipe, often in older,
								urban areas.
								<p>
									<b>Combined sewer overflow (CSO)</b>. An event that takes place, often with the aid of a control device, that allows
									for a combined sewer to overflow into area waterways in order to prevent flooding. A CSO event is most likely to
									occur during a heavy rain event.
									<p>
										<b>
											<a name="Escherichia coli"></a>
											<i>Escherichia coli</i> (
											<i>E. coli</i>)</b>. A rod shaped, gram-negative bacterium, commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and feces
										of warm-blooded animals. It is one species within the fecal-coliform group of bacteria and is distinguished from
										other fecal coliforms by biochemical tests. Although most strains of
										<i>E. coli</i> are harmless, some strains cause illness.
										<i>E. coli</i> is an &#8220;indicator&#8221; of fecal contamination and the possible presence of disease-causing organisms.
										<i>E. coli</i> is the preferred indicator for freshwater recreational waters.
										<p>
											<b>Explanatory variable</b>. A quantity of something that varies and can be used to explain increases and decreases
											in another variable. Explanatory variables for recreational waters include rainfall, wave height, and turbidity,
											and are used to explain increases and decreases in
											<i>E. coli</i> concentrations.
											<p>
												<b>Fecal coliforms</b>. A group of bacteria that were used in past to establish standards for fecal contamination
												in recreational waters. Fecal coliforms are still used to establish standards for shellfish-harvesting waters
												and for some permitting applications. Although they are used to assess fecal contamination of water, some fecal
												coliforms actually come from nonfecal sources. Fecal coliforms are defined by the methodology used for detection
												(lactose fermentation at 44.5°C).
												<p>
													<b>
														<a name="Foreshore head"></a>Foreshore head</b>. Water level data from a piezometer (shallow ground-water well) installed 20 ft inland
													from the edge of water. The foreshore head measured in this manner can best be characterized as a combination
													of the pressure changes due to the local water table, fluctuations in barometric pressure, the water level in
													the lake, and the pressure variance due to wave action
													<a href="https:/pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1066/">(Francy and others, 2009)</a>.
													<p>
														<b>Indicator bacteria</b>. A type or group of bacteria that indicate the possible presence of disease causing
														(pathogenic) microorganisms. Indicator bacteria are not usually pathogenic themselves, but they are often associated
														with pathogens because they are present in large quantities in the feces of warm-blooded animals.
														<p>
															<b>Membrane filtration</b>. A technique used for the detection and enumeration of bacteria from water. This method
															provides a direct count of bacteria based on the growth of colonies on the surface of a membrane filter through
															which sample was passed. To assess the sanitary quality of water using bacterial indicators such as
															<i>E. coli</i>, the number is expressed as colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL).
															<p>
																<b>Milliliter</b>. A milliliter is a metric unit of volume equivalent to one-millionth of a cubic meter. 100
																milliliters is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces or slightly less than ½ cup.
																<p>
																	<b>Multiple linear regression (MLR)</b>. A standard statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables
																	to predict the outcome of another variable (response variable). The goal of MLR is to select a group of
																	explanatory variables that explain as much as possible of the variation observed in the response variable,
																	leaving as little variation as possible to unexplained &#8220;noise.&#8221; In the case of predictive models
																	for swimming areas, rainfall and wave height are examples of explanatory variables and
																	<i>E. coli</i> is the response variable.
																	<p>
																		<b>Nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU)</b>. A unit of measure for the turbidity (cloudiness) of water.
																		<p>
																			<b>Nowcasting</b>. A &#8220;nowcast&#8221; of recreational water quality is similar to a weather forecast
																			except it provides an estimate of current conditions instead of future conditions. A nowcast gives the
																			probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded and swimming would result in an excessive
																			health risk.
																			<p>
																				<b>Pathogen</b>. An organism that causes disease.
																				<p>
																					<b>
																						<a name="PAR"></a>Photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)</b>. Radiation in the 400-700 nanometer range measured
																					by use of sensor at the swimming area. PAR from the previous day is negatively related to the concentration
																					of
																					<i>E. coli</i> in water at some swimming areas.
																					<p>
																						<b>
																							<a name="Predictive models"></a>Predictive models</b>. Mathematical models that use easily measured environmental and water-quality
																						variables (&#8220;explanatory variables&#8221;), such as wave height and rainfall, to estimate the
																						<i>E. coli</i> concentration or the probability of exceeding the bathing-water standard of 235 col/100
																						mL
																						<i>E. coli</i>.
																						<p>
																							<b>
																								<a name="Primary-contact waters"></a>Primary-contact waters</b> are suitable for full-body contact such as swimming, canoeing, and
																							scuba diving.
																							<p>
																								<b>
																									<a name="qPCR"></a>qPCR</b>. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction. qPCR is a rapid analytical method that can
																								be performed in about 2 hours. It is a molecular method that targets the DNA of a specific organism
																								&#8211; for recreational water-quality, qPCR methods were designed to target genes specific for
																								<i>E. coli</i> or enterococci.
																								<p>
																									<b>Recreational water-quality standards</b>. Standards established by the state and based on recommendations
																									and epidemiological studies from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, they are used to decide
																									when to issue a water-quality advisory. In New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the single-sample bathing-water
																									standard for
																									<i>E. coli</i> is 235 colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL). This means that when the
																									<i>E. coli</i> concentration is equal to or greater than 235 col/100 mL, swimming in the water would
																									pose a high risk of illness.
																									<p>
																										<b>Sanitary sewer overflow (SSO)</b>. An event that takes place in which sewage from a sanitary sewer
																										system overflows, or spills, often from a sanitary manhole. A SSO can occur if a blockage is present
																										within a sanitary sewer system and/or there is too much flow.
																										<p>
																											<b>
																												<a name="Threshold probability"></a>Threshold probability</b>. To decided whether or not there&#8217;s too great a risk to go
																											swimming on any particular day, managers at swimming areas establish a site-specific threshold
																											probability based on historical data. Probabilities equal to or above the threshold would indicate
																											to the manager that
																											<i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely above the standard, and an advisory would be issued.
																											Probabilities below the threshold indicate that
																											<i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely below the standard.
																											<p>
																												<b>Turbidity</b>. A quantitative value for the clarity of water sample&#8212;the higher the turbidity
																												the more cloudy the water. Turbidity is measured with a turbidimeter, which measures the scattering
																												effect that suspended particles have on light.
																												<p>
																													<b>Virus</b>. A submicroscopic particle (are too small to be seen by regular light microscopes)
																													that is only able to replicate by taking over the machinery of a living cell. Many viruses cause
																													disease.
																													<p>
																														<b>Water quality</b>. A term used to describe the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics
																														of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.
																														<p>
																															<b>
																																<a name="Water-quality advisory"></a>Water-quality advisory</b>. A public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted
																															at the swimming area and (or) on the Internet, to advise the public that current recreational
																															water-quality standards are not acceptable for swimming because of elevated
																															<i>E. coli</i> levels.
