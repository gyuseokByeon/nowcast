<p>The Cuyahoga River at Jaite (Brecksville, Oh) is in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/cuva/" target="_blank">Cuyahoga Valley National Park</a>.</p>

<p>This is a test of the nowcast for the Cuyahoga River. The nowcast issues advisories and predicts the concentrations of <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) once a day at the posted time only. The predicted concentrations are for a specific site along the river and are for information only. Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality.</p>

<p>Cuyahoga Valley National Park is presently developing strategies to protect and enhance river values, including adequate and safe approaches for recreational river use.
NPS staff recently completed three temporary, primitive access sites for paddlers at the Boston Store Visitor Center, Red Lock, and Station Road Bridge Trailhead as part of a study to look at recreational use on this stretch of the Cuyahoga River.
This area is open to public river use but the park does NOT clear hazards within the river. A dangerous low-head dam is present at Station Road that requires a portage. Paddlers must be experienced and paddle at their own risk.

<p>In previous years, water-quality standards set the single-sample maximum at 298 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters. Current water quality standards (Ohio EPA, 2017) do not specify a not-to-exceed numeric criterion in a single sample for primary-contact recreation. However, a &#8220;beach action value&#8221; of 235 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters, which is more protective in regards to public health, is specified in the Administrative Code. Therefore, for the purposes of determining recreational water-quality conditions in the Cuyahoga River, the beach action value will be used as a benchmark to evaluate water quality.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Cuyahoga River nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>For the Cuyahoga River at Jaite, a model based on turbidity as measured by the in-situ turbidity sensor and rainfall as observed at the Akron-Fulton International Airport will be used for the nowcast in 2018. On days when the predicted <i>E. coli</i> concentrations in the river are below 235 <i>E. coli</i> per 100 milliliters, the water quality will be considered &#8220;good&#8221;.</p>
