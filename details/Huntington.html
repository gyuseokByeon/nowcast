<p>Huntington beach (Bay Village, OH) is operated by <a href="https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks" target="_blank">Cleveland Metroparks</a>. The nowcast has been used at Huntington since 2006.</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by the <a href="http://www.ccbh.net/" target="_blank">Cuyahoga County Board of Health</a> by 9:30 AM (EDT) every day during the swimming season. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability once a day at the posted time only. There are other factors such as waves, currents, algae or other dangers that would prompt a Beach Manager to issue a No Swim Advisory.  Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality. Please click <a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/swimming" target="_blank">here</a> to view the current swimming status.</p>

<p>Beach water quality information at Huntington Reservation and other beaches around Ohio is also available through <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Huntington nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>The variables below will be used in a model to predict the probability of exceeding the <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL).  If the probability exceeds the established threshold (32%), the beach is posted with a swimming advisory.</p>
