<p>

<p>Maumee Bay State Park is operated by <a href="http://parks.ohiodnr.gov/maumeebay" target="_blank">Ohio Department of Natural Resources</a>.  The nowcast has been used at the Lake Erie beach since 2011.</p>


<p>The nowcast is for the Lake Erie beach only. For water-quality information on the inland beach at Maumee Bay State Park and other beaches around Ohio, refer to <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by the <a href="https://www.utoledo.edu/nsm/lec/" target="_blank">University of Toledo, Lake Erie Center</a> by 9:30 AM (EDT) 5 days/week during the swimming season. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability of exceeding the <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) beach action value once a day at the posted time only. Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality.</p>


<p>For information on advisories from harmful algal blooms (HABs), which are different than Ohio Nowcast advisories based on <i>E. coli</i> concentrations, refer to the <a href="http://wwwapp.epa.ohio.gov/gis/mapportal/HAB_Monitoring.html" target="_blank">Ohio EPA HAB map</a>.</p>


<p>For further information, contact Pam Struffolino, University of Toledo (<a href="mailto:Pamela.struffolino@utoledo.edu" target="_blank">Pamela.struffolino@utoledo.edu</a>, 419-530-8366).</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Maumee Bay State Park nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>The variables below will be used in a model to predict the probability of exceeding the <i>E. coli</i> beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL).  If the probability exceeds the established threshold (39%), the beach is posted with a swimming advisory.</p>
