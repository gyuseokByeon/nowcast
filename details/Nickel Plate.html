<p>Nickel Plate beach is operated by the <!--http://www.cityofhuron.org/huron/--> <a href="http://www.cityofhuron.org/huron/parks-and-recreation-parks.html#nickelplate" target="_blank">City of Huron</a> and monitored by the <a href="http://eriecohealthohio.org/" target="_blank">Erie County Health Department</a>.  The nowcast has been used at Nickel Plate since 2014.</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by Erie County Health Department by noon (EDT) Monday-Thursday during the swimming season. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability once a day at the posted time only. Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality.</p>

<p>Beach water quality information at Nickel Plate and other beaches around Ohio is also available through <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Nickel Plate nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>The variables below will be used in a model to predict the probability of exceeding the <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL).  If the probability exceeds the established threshold (32%), the beach is posted with a swimming advisory.</p>
