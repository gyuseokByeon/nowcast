<p>Villa Angela beach and Euclid beach are part of Euclid Creek Reservation, operated by <a href="https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/parks" target="_blank">Cleveland Metroparks</a>.</p>

<p>The information on this page is updated by the <a href="https://www.neorsd.org/beaches-and-water-quality/" target="_blank">Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District</a> by 9:00 AM (EDT) every day during the swimming season and is intended to inform the public of water quality advisories based on the bacteria levels in the bathing waters. This nowcast issues advisories and predicts the probability once a day at the posted time only. There are other factors such as waves, currents, algae or other dangers that would prompt a Beach Manager to issue a No Swim Advisory.  Storms are likely to result in a quick change in water quality. Please click  <a href="http://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/swimming/" target="_blank">here</a> to view the current swimming status.</p>

<p>Beach water quality information at Villa Angela and Euclid and other beaches around Ohio is also available through <a href="http://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">BeachGuard</a>, operated by Ohio Department of Health.</p>

<h5><b>Variables used in the Villa Angela/Euclid nowcast model</b></h5>

<p>The variables below will be used in a nowcast model to predict when water-quality conditions exceed beach action value of 235 most-probable number/100 mL (MPN/100 mL) <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>). If the probability exceeds the established threshold (50%), the beach is posted with a swimming advisory.</p>
